# NOTES:
It is clear that several students do not have the required background for the course. 
In order to accommodate those who do not have the prerequisite for the class, I have decided to make the lab work in groups (of no more than 6 people) instead of individually. This approach allows for more collaboration and teamwork among group members, which can lead to more diverse perspectives and ideas. It also allows students to learn from each other and share their knowledge and skills, which can help to improve their overall understanding of the topic.
